                    <h1>Classification Of Trees</h1>
                    <p>The ancient Greeks developed a classification about 300 bce in which plants were grouped according to their general form—that is, as trees, shrubs, undershrubs, and vines. This classification was used for almost 1,000 years. Modern classifications of plants attempt to assign a plant to a particular taxon and establish relationships with other plants based on genetics, cytology, ecology, behavior, and probable evolutionary lineages, in addition to gross morphology. Popular classifications, however, remain useful tools for studying the common stresses that the environment exerts on all plants and the general patterns of adaptation that are shown no matter how distantly plants are related.</p>
                    <p>Trees have been grouped in various ways, some of which more or less parallel their scientific classification: softwoods are conifers, and hardwoods are dicotyledons. Hardwoods are also known as broadleaf trees. The designations softwood, hardwood, and broadleaf, however, are often imprecise. The wood of some hardwoods—for example, certain willows and poplars and the softest of all woods, balsa—is softer than that of some softwoods—e.g., the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). Similarly, some broadleaf trees (tree heaths, Erica arborea, and some tamarisks).</p>

                            <h1>Introduction To Lighthouse</h1>
                            <p>A lighthouse is a tower, often with a light at the top, built to guide ships at sea, particularly at night or in foggy conditions.Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool to help you improve the quality of web pages. You can run it on any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, SEO, and more.You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, from the command line, or as a Node module. Give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page performed. Use the failed audits as indicators for how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference that explains why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.</p>
